# Product-Management-with-Marketing-Analytics
Customer segmentation was performed using hierarchial clustering, K-means clustering, and K-means with Principle Component Analysis and observed four main segments of customers in the data.
With the help of logistic regression and price elasticity, I identified the tipping point of each of the segments and their contribution to the revenue.
Further, I used multi-nominal logistic regression and understood the product choice of each of the segment. I then applied cross-price elasticity to gather insights between all the products and how it affects each of the segments with price range and promotions.
I concluded the project by drawing product management and customer satisfaction suggestions.
